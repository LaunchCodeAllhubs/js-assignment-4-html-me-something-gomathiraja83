         <h2>Cabin House at Branson,MO</h2>
         <p>My Trip to Branson had started with a cool breezy weather with my family.  
            It was 4 hours of road Trip. In an hour afer starting, the weather turned into a stormy rain. 
            It was a pouring rain with zero visibility, resulting in slowing down the traffic. But half an hour later, the weather was back to normal and we could get to the Cabin house safely.
            Including us, there were 6 families.  We all stayed in a big cabin house together. It was a great experience of being together as a family. There were 10 Children along with my kids in different age group.
            We all Played waterbaloon game. That was not only enjoyable for the kids but also for adults too. We cooked our dinner together and had it in the moonlight. Since it is a full moon day, the moon was so bright.
            That experience was an amazing one! We played dumb charades game. It was so fun to watch our friends act. I enjoyed every moment of being in that Cabin house. That 2days experience made that empty house into a beautiful home!
