            <h2>On the Road to  Branson,MO</h2>
            <p>
                        My Trip to Branson had started with a cool breezy weather with my family.
               It was 4 hours of road Trip. In an hour afer starting, the weather turned into a stormy rain.
               It was a pouring rain with zero visibility, resulting in slowing down the traffic. But half an hour
               later, the weather was back to normal. After passing two hours on the road, We took a 30mins break. 
               The remaining two hours of road was through the mountains. It was so gorgeous. 
               Yay, Here we are! Reached the Big Cabin House.

            <h2>Cabin House at Branson,MO</h2>
            <p class="navyparagraph">
                      Including us, there were 6 families. We all stayed in a big cabin house together. It was a great
               experience of being together as a family. There were 10 Children along with my kids in different age
               group.
               We all Played waterbaloon game. That was not only enjoyable for the kids but also for adults too. We
               cooked our dinner together and had it in the moonlight. Since it is a full moon day, the moon was so
               bright.
               That experience was an amazing one! We played dumb charades game. It was so fun to watch our friends act.
               I enjoyed every moment of being in that Cabin house. That 2days experience made that empty house into a
               beautiful home!

               beautiful nature. We were splashing the water with each other and played some water games. It was a memorable experience.

               The Lost Caverns is a mesmerizing place. We drove a golf cart in the entire tour. that cavern was filled with lot of beautiful
               waterfalls and sceneries. The caverns itself has gorgeous waterfalls inside the cave. There is no word to explain its beauty.

            <h2>The Mountain Coaster</h2>
            <p>
               I am not a ride lover. But when I saw this mountain coaster, 
               I was thinking like its a simple one and I hopped on it alone. .
               In the beginning, It was taking me up slowly, I was enjoying the way up of the mountain. Once it reached the top, then the 
               party started. The speed and height made me little panic. I was just hanging on till it reached the destination point. It was definitely thrilling!
